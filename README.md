# Socket Stats Performance Analysis Data

This repository contains the comparison data that was collected while preparing a comparative analysis of performance of results obtained by using the newly proposed `ss` (Socket Stats) and Tracing in ns-3. Also, the datasets for memory and time data have been added for reference. This contains comparison on three different TCP variants: BBR, LinuxReno and Cubic. 
In addition to this, the repository also contains scripts to generate the plots present in the paper: [Linux-like Socket Statistics Utility for ns-3](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3592149.3592164)
